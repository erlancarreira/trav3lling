    <p>▪Hi folks! Here is Israel again. Well… if you´re here that´s because you have enjoyed the app and what it represents. As I said in the homepage text, the app’s purpose is to spread knowledge throughout the world in a funny way and to exchange knowledge and experiences. It also has the purpose of helping you enjoy your lifetime used for new hobbies learning, former jobs or knowledge acquired, by spreading not only your learning but also your point of view about it. After all, if we stick to a single point of view, we do not evolve as human beings neither as specie.

<p>▪So join the trav3lling team so we can spread this concept throughout the world. You can help us in different ways: tell your friends about us, publish in your social networks or donate any amount so that we are able to improve the app. All money donated will be invested in the app itself.</p>

<p>▪ That´s it folks! I hope you enjoy the app, learn and teach a lot</p>
